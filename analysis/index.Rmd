In the spirit of reproducibility this project website is created that outlines analysis done for the following publication:

*The bacterial biome of ticks and their wildlife hosts at the sylvatic urban interface.* 

**Authors**: Siobhon L. Egan, Casey L. Taylor, Peter B. Banks, Amy S. Northover, Liisa A. Ahlstrom, Una M. Ryan, Peter J. Irwin, Charlotte L. Oskam. 

This publication is also a chpater of my PhD Thesis 2021
